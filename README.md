# Bungalu

Today we went to lunch at one of my favorite restaurants and our regular waiter Jacob said that the QR code menus didn't work because the owner forgot to update the website. 

I told him to text me screenshots of the menu and I would make a site for him.  He did and after lunch I created this site.

I've used https://aider.chat before so it was pretty quick for me to throw this together.  I hooked it up to Cloudflare pages and the domain I already have setup there, so the git checkins will automatically deploy the site.  This came in handy when I decided to crop all the screenshots he sent me to make it look a little nicer.

Then I added a link to their Google Maps page just for fun.
